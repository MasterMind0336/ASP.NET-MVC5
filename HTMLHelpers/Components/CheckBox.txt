=> 1st Argument in @Html.CheckBox() is check box's name by which you can access check box
or put validations for check box on your backend


=> 2nd Argument is used in very rare cases, it is optional and if you want to display your
check box pre-checked when you run first time your application,
then write true in your 2nd Argument.

For Example:
------------

@Html.CheckBox("Accept") &nbsp;
@Html.label("I accept to all the terms and conditions",true)

=> Now, when you run your application, you will see your check box already checked.
